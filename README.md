## 🚗 Mecanum-Wheel Robotics Driver & Simulator
Designed a modular C++ driver, controller, and text-based simulator for a Raspberry Pi Mecanum-wheel robotic vehicle.  
Implemented motor abstractions, coordinated multi-wheel movement, tracked position and orientation in a virtual grid, and validated behaviors in simulation before executing commands on the physical car.

**Key Skills:** C++, object-oriented design, hardware abstraction, simulation, multi-file architecture, systems validation.

## 🛩 Drone Fleet Management System
Built a C-based system to manage and analyze operational data across multiple drones.  
Supports structured storage, search by ID, battery analysis, and menu-driven user interaction using constrained array-based design.

**Key Skills:** C, structured programming, data management, input validation, systems integration.

## 💰 Personal Finance Tracker
Developed a C++ command-line application for tracking income, expenses, and balance calculations.  
Focused on modular design and interactive user workflows.

**Key Skills:** C++, program structure, user input/output, computation logic.

---

## 📦 Inventory Management Application
Created a C++ system for storing, retrieving, and displaying product information such as quantity and price through a menu-driven interface and dynamic data storage.

**Key Skills:** C++, structs/classes, vectors, loops, data organization.
